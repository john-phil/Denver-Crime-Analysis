## Project Description: Analyzing crime rates with neighborhood demographic data from 2018 to 2023.
### Performed a number of different functions within Jupyer Notebooks
- Data wrangling and subsetting
  - Changing data types
  - Creating new dataframes
- Data consistency checks
  - Fixed mixed-type variables
  - Found and dealt with missing values
  - Found and removed duplicates
- Combined and exported data
  - Merged two data sets (crime data with dempgraphic data)
- Derived new variables
  - Created a new column, 'Danger_Score' to have a composite number reflecting crime frequency and number of victims per crime.
- Grouped and aggregated data
  - Created new flags to assist with analysis
  - Created summary columns of descriptive statistics using the groupby() function
- Used data visualization in Python
  - Created histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots 
- Utilized basic machine learning techniques to tease out the variables having the biggest effect on crime
  - Linear regression
  - k-means cluster analysis
### Created a Tableau storyboard detailing my linear regression and cluster analyses 
- Included 6 pages in the storyboard highlighting EDA, linear regression, cluster analysis and findings, and future steps.
